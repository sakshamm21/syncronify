# Test accounts and demo data

Syncronify normally emails verification codes and password-reset links. This project runs **without an email service**, so it ships with ready-made accounts and realistic demo data that anyone can use straight away.

> **Every account uses the password `syncronify123`.**
> These are public test credentials. Don't store anything private in them.

- **Live app:** https://syncronify-self.vercel.app → **Sign in**. The sign-in page has one-click buttons for the Member, Organizer and Admin accounts.
- **On your machine:** `npm run dev:memory` loads this data automatically on first run (see the [README](README.md#getting-started)).

The data itself lives in [`server/scripts/demo-data.ts`](server/scripts/demo-data.ts), as plain, readable data; edit it to add your own accounts or events.

## Things to try

**As `member@syncronify.dev`**
- Dashboard: your tickets, recommendations from your interests, the bell with unread notifications.
- Explore: search, filter by category, RSVP to something new (and enjoy the confetti).
- Schedule: your week in a calendar, including private plans; click a day to add one.
- Open *Tech Summit 2026* → chat with other attendees.
- Ask Sync (header button or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>): *"What's on my calendar this week?"* or *"Any tech events this weekend?"*

**As `organizer@syncronify.dev`**
- Organizer console: stats, the full hackathon, the draft and the cancelled event.
- Open an event's **Attendees**: check people in, export CSV.
- Post an **announcement** in an event chat (attendees are notified).
- Publish the draft, or create a new event with venue search.

**As `admin@syncronify.dev`**
- Approve Asha's application, then sign in as `asha@` and publish an event.
- Suspend a tester account, then try signing in as it.

**Waitlist in action:** sign in as `member@` and leave the hackathon. Then sign in as `ishaan@`: he's been moved up and notified.

## Signing up and resetting passwords without email

You can still create your own account:

1. **Sign up** with any email address (it doesn't need to be real).
2. The verification code that would normally be emailed is **shown on the screen** instead. Enter it to finish.
3. **Forgot password** works the same way: the reset link appears on screen.

This is on everywhere while no email service is configured. When SMTP settings are added, codes go to real inboxes and are no longer shown (see `EXPOSE_VERIFICATION_CODES` in the README).

## Resetting the data

People will change the shared accounts (RSVPs, notes, approvals). To start fresh:

```bash
# Local, with npm run dev:memory: stop the app, then
rm -rf server/.data          # next `npm run dev:memory` reloads the demo data

# Any database (uses DB_URI from server/.env)
npm --prefix server run seed -- --reset   # wipes everything, then loads fresh data with new dates
```

The seed script refuses to run with `NODE_ENV=production`, so it can't wipe a production database by accident.
